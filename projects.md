### Ecological Integrity Simulations

2005 to 2012

Conservation biologists collect data in order to make predictions about the long-term health of ecosystems under their management. Converting these data into useful predictions requires statistical analyses. A crucial consideration in these analyses is the power of the statistical test: the ability to detect a change when, in fact, a change has occurred. Knowing the power of the tests helps avoid making the inference that nothing is happening, when, perhaps, the ecosystem's health is declining. 

This project developed a set of R functions that construct simulations of processes to estimate statistical power.
